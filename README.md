I originally wanted to write a book as my next (short) project before my next big project (settl), but I really didn't enjoy doing that, and I don't think I've found my groove with writing things like that yet, so instead I'm going to mess around with experimental videogame mechanics and leave the results here

I'll (hopefully) be doing this for the next few months (probably until about June-ish (2023))

Anyone can use anything I put here. You don't even need to attribute me. Its cool man. But if you *do* want to attribute me, then that's very nice of you. I also have a [donation page here](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?business=KJCNCAX9ARVZQ&no_recurring=0&currency_code=USD) if you really, *really* like what I'm doing here. And, I also have a [patreon page here](https://www.patreon.com/user?u=83778845) with (almost) literally nothing on it

I'm primarily going to be using Godot engine because I like the idea of learning it, and its free :)

Here's some mechanics that I want to try out (there are more that I don't have listed). Hopefully I can get through everything I add to this list in the next 4 months, or however long:

- [X] View movement based jumping control (eg: rotate view up while jumping to jump higher, etc)
  - [X] 3d [Probably done. Outcome was good-feeling movement]
  - [X] 2d [Probably done with this as well. Feels good]

- [X] Other misc movement mechanics, that may also have been done before
  - [X] Fast falling: like double jumping but downward [Easy to implement and feels great]
  - [X] Crouch-jumping [Quite difficult to get the timing right, but easy to implement]
  - [X] Turn-around jumping: the old flash game Money Seize used this, 3d mario games used this (?), probably others [Works well and easily implemented]

- [X] Jump-only movement: moving by making short hops that feel like regular walking / running with view bob [This is such a cute way to move around. It was really easy to implement too]

- [ ] Jumpcasting (parabolic curve casting to colliding geometry) to adjust jumps to always land safely in 2d/3d platformer

- [ ] Contextual movement mechanics
  - [ ] Ledge grabbing using raycasts to arbitrary geometries
  - [ ] Shimmying around objects
  - [ ] Clinging onto nearby objects

- [ ] Push, pull, and drag tools as alternative to grappeling hook mechanics

- [ ] Player-equivalent NPCs in simulated world (eg: computer controlled players in a fake MMO)

- [ ] Guided / weakly-informed procedural generation and single-seed game worlds

- [ ] Free object equivalent to falling sand simulation

- [ ] A first-person version of a punching / fighting game mechanic

- [ ] "Flight simulator"
  - [ ] Huge object procedurally generated world, so there are large objects you're flying around and through
  - [ ] Not physically accurate simulated lift, drag, etc that feels good for arcadey movement, etc
  - [ ] Interesting, and enjoyable to use movement mechanics:
    - [ ] Forward acceleration, airbrakes, boosted forward acceleration
    - [ ] Side-to-side boosting / dashing, air-hops, etc
    - [ ] Ground bouncing mechanic
    - [ ] Short range teleportation, and long-range-teleporation as a mechanic
    - [ ] Wing-retraction for free rotation despite air resistance, drag, etc
    - [ ] Flipping around / 180 rotation
  - [ ] Weapons?
