I originally wanted to write a book as my next (short) project before my next big project (settl), but I really didn't enjoy doing that, and I don't think I've found my groove with writing things like that yet, so instead I'm going to mess around with experimental videogame mechanics and leave the results here

I'll (hopefully) be doing this for the next few months (probably until about June-ish (2023))

Anyone can use anything I put here. You don't even need to attribute me. Its cool man. But if you *do* want to attribute me, then that's very nice of you. I also have a [donation page here](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?business=KJCNCAX9ARVZQ&no_recurring=0&currency_code=USD) if you really, *really* like what I'm doing here. And, I also have a [patreon page here](https://www.patreon.com/user?u=83778845) with (almost) literally nothing on it

Here's some mechanics that I want to try out (there are more that I don't have listed). Hopefully I can get through everything I add to this list in the next 4 months, or however long:

- [ ] View movement based jumping control (eg: rotate view up while jumping to jump higher, etc)
  - [ ] 3d
  - [ ] 2d

- [ ] Contextual movement models
  - [ ] Ledge grabbing using raycasts to arbitrary geometries
  - [ ] Shimmying around objects

- [ ] Player-equivalent NPCs in simulated world (eg: computer controlled players in a fake MMO)

- [ ] Guided / weakly-informed procedural generation and single-seed game worlds

- [ ] Push, pull, and drag tools as alternative to grappeling hook mechanics
